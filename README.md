# 2D Physics Engine


A virtual environment developed with C++ and SFML. This engine is best served for RPG type games as the state design pattern is the primary tool used to model the different actions available.

The main goals of this project are to gain a more fundamental understanding of the underlying math used in the creation of physics engines as well as getting more comfortable with programming more complex things in C++.
