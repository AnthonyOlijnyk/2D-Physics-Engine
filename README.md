# 2D Physics Engine


A virtual environment developed with C++ and SFML. This engine is best served for RPG type games as the state design pattern is the primary tool used to model the different actions available.

The main goal of the project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the underlying math used in the creation of physics engines while becoming accustomed to more complex C++ code.
